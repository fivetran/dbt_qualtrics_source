# v0.2.0 dbt_qualtrics_source

[PR #5](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_qualtrics_source/pull/5) includes the following updates: 

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes: Bug Fixes ðŸš¨
- Casted the following timestamp fields in the below models using the `dbt.type_timestamp()` macro. This is necessary to ensure all timestamps are consistently casted and do not experience datatype mismatches in downstream transformations.

> Please note: this update will likely only impact Redshift destinations as it was found the connector synced these fields as `timestamp with time zone` when in fact they were without. Most users will not see any changes following this release. But we marked this as breaking to ensure no possible datatype conflicts downstream.

## Under the Hood
- Updated the maintainer PR template to resemble the most up to date format.
- Added the auto release GitHub Action for easier deployment.
